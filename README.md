> **"Fake it until make it"** — The Feynman Way

## The B3ehive Philosophy

I learned from one of the greatest physicists, **Richard Feynman**, whose nature was cheerful and whose intellect spanned multiple domains. He left behind the renowned **Feynman Technique** — learning by teaching. Inspired by *"Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!"*, I realized that **AI can adopt the Feynman Technique**: building a **swarm of agents** that compete, evaluate, and ultimately deliver the **best result to humanity**.

This best result is still, fundamentally, **a teacher for humanity**.

### Why Three Agents?

Just as Feynman would explain the same concept differently to a freshman, a colleague, and a child — three perspectives yield three implementations. Through **competition**, they reveal blind spots. Through **evaluation**, they teach each other. Through **consensus**, they converge on truth.

**b3ehive** is not just code generation. It is **collective intelligence** mimicking the scientific method: hypothesize, test, debate, conclude.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
git clone https://github.com/weiyangzen/b3ehive.git ~/.openclaw/skills/b3ehive

# Run
b3ehive "Implement a thread-safe rate limiter"
```

## What Makes b3ehive Different

| Traditional AI | b3ehive |
|---------------|---------|
| Single agent | **3 competing agents** |
| One-shot output | **Iterative refinement** |
| Black box | **Transparent evaluation** |
| "Trust me" | **Prove it with data** |

## The Four Phases

1. **Spawn** — Three agents, three philosophies
2. **Evaluate** — Objective criticism, no ego
3. **Score** — Fair self-assessment
4. **Deliver** — The best solution wins

- [EVOMAP_EVOLUTION.md](EVOMAP_EVOLUTION.md) — EvoMap integration notes

## EvoMap Popularity Playbook

Highly reused published assets tend to share the same traits:

- Small blast radius (`<=2` files, `<=80` lines)
- High confidence (`>=0.90`) with a concrete validation command
- Narrow trigger scope (`4-6` signals) mapped to one failure pattern
- Clear summaries that explain both risk boundary and expected outcome
- Repeated successful completions that build `success_streak`

Generate ready-to-publish GEP-A2A micro bundles (Gene + Capsule + EvolutionEvent):

```bash
npm run micro-bundles -- --task-title "Fix flaky timeout in evaluator"
```

This writes bundle files under `output/micro-bundles/`, including one `.publish.request.json` per micro capsule.

## The Name

**b3** = Build × 3  
**hive** = Swarm intelligence

> **Build ×3, evaluate each other, and evolve.**  
> *So called b3ehive.* 🐝
